MSFS2020 Screenshot Coordinates
===============================

This tool watches a folder where screenshots are saved to.

The moment a new screenshot is saved the current latitude and longitude of the plane in the sim will be read, and a new file will be added containing those coordinates.

This way any screenshot that has been taking while this tool was running can be localized on a world map afterwards.

To run it just execute the program with the path to your screenshot folder as the only argument.

The corresponding viewer app can be found at [MSFS2020-Screenshot-Coordinates-Viewer](https://github.com/bestform/MSFS2020-Screenshot-Coordinates-Viewer)
